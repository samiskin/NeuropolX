NeuropolX
=========

This game was based off of the popular online game Amorphous+ by Innocuous Games (http://armorgames.com/play/2044/amorphous-plus) 

It was made completely in Java while I was in Grade 11.  The graphics were all made in Illustrator or Photoshop, and the code was written using the Eclipse IDE.
